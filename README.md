## About The Project

Gravity Forms is a powerful tool, but viewing entries sometimes requires navigating deep into the WordPress admin area. This plugin was created to solve that problem by providing a beautiful, dedicated, and secure page at `/gf-entries` where administrators can quickly view, filter, and browse entries from any form.

It's designed to be lightweight, secure, and highly user-friendly, with a focus on clean code and a professional user interface.

## ✨ Features

- **Auto-Updates from GitHub:** Receive update notifications directly in your WordPress dashboard whenever a new version is released here.
- **Dynamic Form Selector:** Easily switch between all your available Gravity Forms with a simple dropdown menu.
- **Advanced Filtering:** Filter entries by their exact payment status (e.g., "پرداخت موفق", "در انتظار پرداخت").
- **Smart File & Image Previews:**
  - Displays a rich, clickable preview for image uploads.
  - Provides a clean "Download File" button for other file types.
- **Secure Access:** The viewer page is strictly accessible only to users with administrator privileges.
