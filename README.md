## About The Project

Gravity Forms is a powerful tool, but viewing entries sometimes requires navigating deep into the WordPress admin area. This plugin was created to solve that problem by providing a beautiful, dedicated, and secure page at `/gf-entries` where administrators can quickly view, filter, and browse entries from any form.

It's designed to be lightweight, secure, and highly user-friendly, with a focus on clean code and a professional user interface.
